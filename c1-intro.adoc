## c. WMO-CF Extensions

### Definitions

*CF Conventions.* The NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (CF Conventions) define a minimum set of metadata required to ensure that conforming netCDF files meet a basic level of self-description and interoperability. The required (minimal) set of metadata ensures that all variables in a dataset have “an associated description of what it represents, including physical units if appropriate, and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based coordinates) and time”. Additional metadata are defined by the CF Conventions but are only recommended where they may not be needed or appropriate for all datasets.

Current and previous versions of the CF Conventions can be found at: https://cfconventions.org/[https://cfconventions.org/.]

*WMO-CF Extensions.* The WMO-CF Extensions build on the CF Conventions to provide the framework for standardizing semantics and metadata, further reducing the effort involved in specifying data products and increasing interoperability. 

The WMO-CF Extensions:

• Define additional metadata requirements or recommendations that are not defined by the CF Conventions;

• Specify the set of optional CF Conventions metadata that each extension requires, making those optional metadata mandatory.

*WMO-CF Profiles.* The WMO-CF Profiles implement the WMO-CF Extensions for different data types by, inter alia: defining the standardized metadata and semantics; specifying the names of dimension and coordinate variables; and specifying the ordering of dimensions. The WMO-CF Profiles reduce the degrees of freedom available when creating netCDF files, increasing the standardization of data from different publishers for the same type of data.
