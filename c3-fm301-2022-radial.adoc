|*301.1* |*Scope*
|301.1.1 |This profile is for the representation of weather radar and lidar data in the native instrument-centric polar coordinates. Such data are the primary output of the radar/lidar signal processor known as “Level 2” data. This is the lowest level output commonly available from operational instruments and is well suited to data exchange.

_Note: The structure of this profile is compatible with the data models for weather radar data exchange available at https://community.wmo.int/en/activity-areas/
weather-radar-observations/radar-data-exchange._

|*301.2* |*Overview*
|301.2.1 |Level 2 radar/lidar data may be conceptualized as a simple hierarchy of data objects where each object contains a collection of objects from the level below. These objects are:
|301.2.1.1 |Volume - The top-level object for the profile. A volume is a collection of logically associated sweeps. Typically, these sweeps will represent a continuous or near-continuous series of observations acquired by the instrument during a single cycle of the scan schedule.
|301.2.1.2 |Sweep - Represents a subset of the data in the volume over which certain fundamental conditions remain constant. A common example is for a sweep to contain the data observed during a single 360-degree scan at a fixed elevation angle.
|301.2.1.3 |Ray - Represents a collection of data along a single direction of pointing from the instrument.
|301.2.1.4 |Range Bin - Represents a collection of data within a ray thatare related to the same short window of range along the beam propagation path.
|301.2.1.5 |Dataset - A measured or calculated quantity that is associated with a range bin. Each dataset will typically represent one of the measured radar moments such as reflectivity or Doppler velocity, but may also be used to store derived information such as quality control metrics.
|301.2.2 |Within a sweep all range bins contain the same collection of datasets, and all rays contain the same collection of range bins. This allows the lower three levels of the hierarchy to be collapsed into a collection of 2-D variables. Each variable stores a single dataset, with dimensions for ray and range bin.
|301.2.3 |To facilitate representation of the hierarchical nature of the data, NetCDF groups are used. The global scope is used to store the volume object, a group is used for each sweep object, and a variable within each sweep group is used for each dataset. Coordinate variables and ancillary variables within the sweep groups provide metadata related to the ray and range bin objects.
